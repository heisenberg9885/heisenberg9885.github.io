## Experience

**Alibaba Group** Intern at Alibaba Intelligent Information department. Resposible for medical research task of Quark browser.

Project:**Browser search query retrieval**: we need to find the corresponding evidence-based medical books and documents when handling medical query searched by the user in the browser.A major difficulty in traditional twin-tower retrieval is the encoding vector representation of long documents. Based on this, the RetroMAE encode method is used, and considering the difference between Chinese and English of whole word masks and the dense medical NER information, the NER module is added to the original model to make the model randomly mask the complete NER information instead of individual characters.In this way, a better vector representation can be obtained.

I also have experience in other task such as NER, MRC, SPO extract during internship.

## Paper 

**RegionRel:A Framework for Jointly Extracting Relational Triplets by Performing Sub-tasks by Region**

An individual completed paper of conference being submitted.This paper mainly aims at the information interaction problem of traditional SPO extraction, and proposes a multi-task interaction model with unified label space, which achieves the sota effect on multiple SPO extraction data sets. Specifically, traditional SPO extraction splits the task into subtasks of entity recognition and relation classification, but does not take information interaction into consideration. This paper designs a model that unifies the label space of the two subtasks so that the subtasks can be executed simultaneously. Multiple experiments show that the model has a better effect in dealing with the overlap pattern.

## Myself

I was major in Mathematics and have studied mathematical statistics, stochastic process, Bayesian theory, convex optimization, matrix analysis and other mathematics courses. My interest in NLP began with my undergraduate graduation project, and I continued to study myself at the master's time. I have a greater interest in scientific research. I hope that I can get professional scientific research guidance through a relatively substantial scientific research practice, and lay a foundation for future scientific research. For the sub area of NLP,I am familiar with information extraction but I am also interested in other area like generation,retrieval.
